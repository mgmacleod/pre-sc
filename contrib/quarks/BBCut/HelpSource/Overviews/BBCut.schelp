summary:: Algorithmic audio splicing
categories:: Libraries>BBCut

BBCut is a collection of SuperCollider classes for automated event analysis, beat induction and algorithmic audio splicing. It is released as public open source under the GNU General Public License. It was written by Nick M. Collins, and is maintained by Nathan Ho since 2016.

section:: Setup

Set code::s.latency = 0.05;:: when using BBCut. The default of 0.2 seconds is dangerous and may interact adversely with scheduling especially for faster tempi and beat tracking. Only tempi in a standard range of around 1-4bps are supported.

Copy break.aiff and break2.aiff from the BBCut source into code::Platform.userExtensionDir +/+ "sounds/"::. This is an optional step, but you will need this to run the examples.

BBCut used to come with three server plugins -- AnalyzeEvents2, AutoTrack, and DrumTrack. AutoTrack is now known as BeatTrack and made it to the core library, and the other two ugens are in sc3-plugins. As a result, sc3-plugins is required. (If you want to use DrumTrack, a fairly recent version is needed.)

section:: Contents

A quick note on naming: the second version of BBCut uses a weird naming scheme so that versions 1 and 2 can coexist without any conflicts. (For example, the main class is called BBCut2.) This is no longer needed because the modern quarks system can take care of multiple versions. The next major version of BBCut will fix the naming scheme.
