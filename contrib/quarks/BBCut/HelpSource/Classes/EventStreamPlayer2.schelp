description::

An EventStreamPlayer2 is used by Event based Patterns for scheduling on an ExternalClock.  
You do not explictly create an EventStreamPlayer2s, they are created for you when you call Pattern-playExt.

The EventStreamPlayer2 holds a stream which returns a series of Events, and a protoEvent. At each call to next, it copies the protoEvent, passes that to the stream, and stores the Event returned into a scheduling queue driven by the external clock.

examples::

code::

s=Server.default;

s.latency=0.05;

c=ExternalClock(TempoClock(2.1)).play;

//playExt= play on External Clock
p=Pbind.new.playExt(c); 

q= Pbind(\dur,Pseq([0.25,0.25,0.5],inf),\freq,Pseq([330,330,550],inf),\sustain, 0.1).playExt(c);

q.mute;
q.unmute;

p.stop;
q.stop;

c.stop;
