class:: SQPushFXPitch2
summary:: CutBuf playback rate algorithm
categories:: Libraries>BBCut
related:: Overviews/BBCut

description::

SQPushFXPitch2 is intended to be used in the pbsfunc (playback speed func) parameter of link::Classes/CutBuf2:: and link::Classes/CutBuf3::. It is exactly the same as link::Classes/CutPBS1::, but only changes the rate sometimes, controlled by a probability argument.

All arguments can be constant values, but they can also be anything that responds to .value. In the latter case, .value is called every block.

The alias link::Classes/CutPBS2:: is available for backward compatibility.

classmethods::

method:: new

argument:: pbm
The common ratio of the geometric sequence. This should be between 0 and 1.

argument:: directfunc
If this is nonpositive, the pitch will go down. If positive, the pitch will go up. If nil, this defaults to a function that decides between -1 and 1.

argument:: pbchance
The probability that the pitch will be shifted at all.

examples::

code::
~buf = BBCutBuffer(Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/break.aiff", 8);

BBCut2(CutGroup([CutBuf3(~buf2, 0.3, pbsfunc: CutPBS1(0.5))]), BBCutProc11()).play(2.5);
