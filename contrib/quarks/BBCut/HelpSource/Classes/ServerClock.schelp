class:: ServerClock
summary:: A server-controlled clock
categories:: Libraries>BBCut
related:: Overviews/BBCut

description::

A scheduling clock driven from OSC Triggers from the Server. Allows the use of a UGen as a beat tracker controlling scheduling. This class assumes a UGen running on the Server, sending OSC trig messages at each beat. 

instancemethods::

method:: play

argument:: trigID
Trigger OSC message ID number. 
argument:: s
Server. 

method:: stop
A ServerClock must be stopped to remove the OSC responder that reacts to triggers sent from the Server. 

examples::

code::

s=Server.default;
s.latency=0.05; //must be small compared to half beat size in tempo

(
//react to an Impulse driven clock on the Server, SendTrig with ID of 100
SynthDef(\help_ServerClock,{arg tempo=2.3, beepvol=0.0, trigID=100;
    var clocktick, beep;
    
    clocktick=Impulse.ar(tempo);
    
    beep= SinOsc.ar(440,0,0.1)*Decay.ar(clocktick,0.1);
    
    Out.ar(0,Pan2.ar(beepvol*beep,0.0));
    
    //trig from clock, trigID 100, always pass current tempo as parameter 
    SendTrig.ar(clocktick,trigID,tempo);    //sends with ID of 100 matching what clock expects
}).send(s);
)

a=Synth(\help_ServerClock);

//set up a ServerClock running off of these triggers
c=ServerClock.new.play(100,s);

//run a bbcut from it
b=BBCutBuffer(Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/break.aiff",8);

d=BBCut2(CutBuf2(b)).play(c);

a.set(\tempo,2.5);
a.set(\tempo,1.7);

//triggers stop
a.free;

//continue triggers
a=Synth(\help_ServerClock)

c.stop; //stop and free OSC responder.

d.free; //free resources

//frees clock
a.free;
