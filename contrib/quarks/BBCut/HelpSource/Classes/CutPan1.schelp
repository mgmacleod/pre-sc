description::

CutPan1 is intended to be used in the panfunc parameter of link:: Classes/CutMixer ::. It pans repeats in each block in an arithmetic sequence starting from 0. The pan is automatically clipped if it goes outside of the range [-1, 1].

classmethods::

method:: new

argument:: directfunc
A function, called every block, that determines the direction to change the pan. If nil, defaults to a function that randomly returns -1 or 1.

argument:: outrate
The common difference of the arithmetic sequence. Defaults to 0.2. This can also be a function, in which case it is called every repeat.

examples::

code::
~buf = BBCutBuffer(Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/break.aiff", 8);

BBCut2(CutGroup([CutBuf3(~buf, 0.3), CutMixer(0, 1, 1, CutPan1(nil, 0.2))]), BBCutProc11()).play(2.5);
