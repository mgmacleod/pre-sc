# BBCut #

BBCut is a SuperCollider package (both for client and server) by Nick Collins for automated event analysis, beat induction and algorithmic audio splicing. Development ceased after version 2.1 was released in 2006, and this repository is a revival maintained by Nathan Ho with documentation and bug fixes.

## Installation ##

To install, copy this directory into `Platform.userExtensionDir`. This gives you all the main BBCut functionality.

The `sounds/` directory contains two audio files, `break.aiff` and `break2.aiff`. Many examples assume that these are in `Platform.resourceDir +/+ "sounds/"`, so copy them over there if you want the examples to run out of the box. This step is optional.
