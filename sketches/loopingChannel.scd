/*
Hacking the loopingStation.scd code to explore approaches for variable-length loops that are not known beforehand.

It's a mockup of what a channel or track might look like and work.  Instead of pre-specified loop lengths, we will keep recording until we get
a signal of some sort from a button / MIDI controller to stop, and then schedule the synth to stop recording at the next bar.
