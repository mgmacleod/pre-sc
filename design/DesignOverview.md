#Overview

The goal is to provide a (mostly electronic) music production tool that blurs the line between production and performance.  Essentially (and somewhat ironically), I want a more traditional way to make non-traditional music.


#Components

##Devices

###Instruments

Currently, there are two kinds of instruments: Audio and MIDI.  At some point, I'd like to add a Code instrument.  

####Audio

Basic audio loop recorder and player.  You record a loop of audio to a clip and play it back.

####MIDI

Synthesizer- and sample-based instruments.  They record MIDI note data to clips which are then played back through the instrument.  


###Effects

FX units that process audio signals.  Can be used either as inserts or sends.


###Controls

Units that modulate the parameters of other devices.
